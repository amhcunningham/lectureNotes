/*COMMENTS SECTION

//value of a comment: communicates to anyone reading our code- us, teammates, other developers

//types of comments
//- single line comments- more common

/*
anything between these... multi line comments
*/

/*
//console.log - outputs some message to the console
*/
//write code, then see it working
console.log('this is a console log message');
console.log('you can separate parts of a console.log message with comma,' , 'just like this');

//orange text? those are strings. the stuff between quotes is a string separated by the punctuation outside the strings

//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log messages in two big ways:
//1 can check status of some JS 'thing'
//2 can check a process we built with repeated console.log messages

//example 1:
var sampleName="Angie";
console.log(sampleName)

//example 2:
var sampleNum= 1;
console.log(sampleNum)
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum)
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum)
